 *
 * @brief An asynchronous object performing a late initialization
 *
 * @b AsyncInitObject is the backbone of Hemera Qt5 SDK. Its initialization paradigm recurs in
 * almost any class exported by the SDK, and allows for a truly asynchronous and transparent
 * workflow in your SDK usage.
 *
 * An @b AsyncInitObject has in most cases an empty constructor, and the whole creation logic is
 * handled during its initialization phase, represented as an @b Operation. The initialization procedure
 * can as well fail, and in that case the object will be unusable.
 *
 * Even though @b AsyncInitObject is heavily used inside Hemera, it is also meant to be exploited
 * in client applications needing specific asynchronous logic.
